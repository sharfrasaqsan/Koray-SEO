      Eye Doctors: Understanding the Difference Between Optometrists,
      Ophthalmologists, and Optical Dispensers
    </h1>
    <div class="intro-section">
      <p class="para-content mobile-para-margin">
        The differences between an optometrist, ophthalmologists, and optical
        dispensers are dependent on the level of education and what service they
        can provide. Optometrists and optical dispensers are not medical
        doctors, however, ophthalmologists are as they have received further
        training in eye care.
        <br />
        An eye doctor is a medical professional who provides eye care and vision
        services and can carry out extensive eye examinations and perform
        surgeries for eye diseases and conditions.
        <br /><br />
        Optometrists vs Ophthalmologist vs Optical Dispenser Optometrists are
        registered healthcare professionals who are trained to evaluate vision,
        prescribe glasses, and diagnose and treat a range of eye conditions.
        They have university qualifications and are registered with the
        Optometry Board of Australia. Ophthalmologists are experts in eye
        management, treating and managing eye diseases and carrying out eye
        surgeries. The term optician is used globally, but is known as optical
        dispenser in Australia. Optical Dispensers are trained to fit and
        dispense glasses based on the prescriptions given by the ophthalmologist
        or optometrist.

        vision. While these are different specialisations of optometry,
        optometrists are not eye specialists and the term eye specialists is
        often used interchangeably with ophthalmologists. The specialisations of
        optometrists are listed below.

      <ul class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Paediatric optometry:</span>
          Paediatric optometrists are specifically trained in diagnosing and
          treating children’s eyes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Low vision optometry:</span>
          Low vision optometrists specialise in performing eye examinations
          specifically catered for low vision and how to maintain remaining
          vision.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Behavioural optometry:</span>
          Behavioural optometrists almost exclusively treat children with eye
          conditions. They look at children’s vision in relation to their daily
          activities such as reading, looking at screens and writing.

          <span class="list-title">Sports vision optometry:</span>
          Sports vision optometrists aim to ensure quality sports performance.
          They look at fundamental aspects of vision such as visual acuity, eye
          tracking, eye focusing, peripheral vision, depth perception, visual
          reaction time, eye-hand coordination, visual memory, visualisation and
          visual concentration.

              Paediatric optometrists are
              <b>on the eye care and health of children, infants and toddlers</b
              >. They can provide care for conditions that are common in these
              ages, such as astigmatism, amblyopia (lazy eye), strabismus
              (crossed or misaligned eyes), colour blindness and eye infections.
              Paediatric optometrists will assess visual acuity, which is the
              quality of vision from varying distances. Older children who are
              able to read, are assessed with the eye chart that is used for an
              adult’s eye examination. Small children will be tested on their
              identification of objects, shapes and colours. They will also
              assess your child’s pupil function and eye movement. This
              specialised field of optometry typically requires additional
              residency in paediatric optometry.

        <p class="para-content">
          Low vision optometry refers to
          <b
            >optometry that concerns limited vision that can not be corrected
            with glasses or types of surgery like LASIK</b
          >, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Low-vision optometrists are
          optometrists that specialise in cases of low vision. Low vision
          differs from blindness as some sight still remains and may be helped
          through visual aids such as telescopic glasses, magnifying glasses,
          hand magnifiers and reading prisms. Other aids include non-optical
          options such as text reading software, check guides, high contrast
          clocks and watches and larger fonts. These optometrists will assess
          how much vision is still remaining and the quality. Depending on which
          of the various types of low vision; loss of central vision, peripheral
          vision, blurred vision, reduced contrast sensitivity, glare light
          sensitivity and night blindness, optometrists can advise what visual
          or non-optical aids may be helpful and how to take care of your
          remaining vision. This specialisation requires a post-graduate
          residency.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">3. Behavioural Optometry</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Behavioural optometry looks into how children’s vision problems may be
          related to the nature of their environment in terms of what their
          visual demands are. The eye examination for this would include the
          routine aspects of a regular eye exam. Optometrists will measure any
          problems with the functionality of your focus and eye coordination,
          these impact how you feel while you read, write and use computers and
          how well you do these activities. They will also measure distance
          focus, check if you are experiencing difficulties looking up from
          screens clearly and assess tracking abilities. For this
          specialisation, optometrists must continue to undertake continuing
          professional development annually, in order to maintain their right to
          practise according to the Australiasian College of Behavioural
          Optometrists.

          glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), dry eye, diabetic
          retinopathy, presbyopia and cataracts. Optometrists will need to test
          for these conditions through eye pressure testing, visual field
          testing (side/peripheral vision), dilated retinal examination, slit
          lamp examination and refraction testing.

          Regulation Agency</b
        >
        and are required to complete CPD activities within each registration
        period. The CPD requirements for all optometrists and ophthalmologists
        in Australia involve a minimum of five hours of interactive CPD, a
        maximum of five hours of non-clinical CPD and for those who are
        therapeutically endorsed it is an additional ten hours of therapeutic
        CPD. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training is also mandatory
        every three years along with the maintenance of a CPD portfolio that
        shows their professional learning goals and the CPD activities that help
        them reach those goals according to the Australian College of Optometry.

          Optometrists provide primary eye care in rural and regional Australia.
          A way they

          according to Robyn Main in a paper published in National Rural Health
          Alliance. In towns where there are very few optometrists available,
          those optometrists are responsible for diagnosing and managing acute
          and chronic diseases such as diabetic eye disease, glaucoma, macular
          degeneration, removing foreign bodies in the eye and identification of
          refractive errors and prescription of glasses and contact lenses
          according to Optometrists Association Australia. These optometrists
          work weekly or fortnightly clinics and optometrists who are just
          visiting have outreach services for Australia’s remote and rural
          communities. There are also a number of initiatives in a plan to
          produce more attraction and incentive for people in regional and rural
          communities to receive training and qualifications as an optometrist
          through scholarship provision and creating opportunities for
          undergraduate training.

          The future of optometrists in Australian healthcare
          <b
            >is planned to involve broadening the current scope of Australian
            optometrists’ skills to ensure the needs of communities around the
            country are being met</b
          >. A significant method in their aim to expand optometrists’ practice
          is the ongoing implementation of optometrist and ophthalmologist
          collaboration models to create improved access to effective treatment.
          The priority in the future is to continue supporting optometrists to
          be able to work at the fullest capacity of their current skills to
          produce eye care services that are consistent and timely.
          Additionally, enabling optometrists to be able to prescribe oral
          therapeutics is believed to be helpful in creating timely access to
          services for patients, according to Margaret Lam in a feature article
          from Mivision. According to the Royal Australian and New Zealand
          College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) solutions to create an improved
          future for ophthalmologists in Australia include creating a map of
          varied healthcare services by specialty, patient demographics, and
          geographic areas to allow for high-quality care to be delivered in the
          suitable places at the right time. Increasing the visibility of
          outpatient services, increasing the total of trainees with a regional
          background, enhancing extensive ophthalmology, and including more
          regional training posts with the intent to train for a complete year
          at a regional post.

          Why Go to an Optometrist Instead of an Ophthalmologist?

          It is advised to go to an

            >optometrist before being referred to an ophthalmologist when
            seeking regular eye care services</b
          >. Optometrists can provide eye exams and tests to assess your eye and
          vision health, for prescription of glasses and contact lenses and to
          ensure there are no symptoms of more serious conditions. Optometrists
          are also trained to prescribe eye medication such as eye drops for
          minor eye problems. Your optometrist would only refer you to an
          ophthalmologist if they have detected symptoms of a condition or
          disease. Ophthalmologists specialise in diagnosing and treating
          complex conditions such as partial or complete vision loss, eye
          injuries, pain and swelling, glaucoma and eye problems related to
          diabetes.
